# 2026-01-26 — MVP pass for desk_tidy_sticky

## What changed
- Added pinned-notes desktop overlay (draggable cards, click-through toggle, always-on-top) to cover the B-side of the AB plan.
- Panel hotkeys: global `Ctrl+Shift+N`, `Enter` save, `Ctrl+Enter` save+pin, `Esc` hide; optional hide-after-save toggle.
- Notes persistence improved: pinned-first ordering, atomic writes, drag position storage for overlay.
- Tray menu updated with overlay entry and icon resolver using packaged app icon.

## How to use
1) Run `flutter run -d windows` (window starts hidden).  
2) `Ctrl+Shift+N` opens the panel; type and hit `Enter` to save and hide.  
3) `Ctrl+Enter` saves and pins. Use the tray → Desktop Overlay to show pinned cards on the desktop; drag to reposition, unpin/delete/done from the card.  
4) Toggle click-through from the overlay toolbar to let mouse pass to the desktop.

## Follow-ups
- Hot-corner trigger parity with desk_tidy.
- Experimental WorkerW embedding toggle for “below icons” mode.
- Sync settings/launch control from the main desk_tidy app.

## Build notes (Windows / VS 2026)
- Flutter 3.32 toolchain defaults to VS2019; patched local `flutter_tools` to map VS 2026 (`Visual Studio 18 2026`) generator. If you refresh the Flutter SDK, re-apply the patch or upgrade Flutter to a version that ships VS 2026 support.
- When switching generators, delete `build/` and `.dart_tool/flutter_build` to clear stale CMake cache.
